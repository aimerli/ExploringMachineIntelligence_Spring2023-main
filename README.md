# ExploringMachineIntelligence_Spring2023-main
Introduction  

This advanced unit introduces Machine Learning (ML) approaches, concepts and methods through direct examples, practical problem solving and core technical training for creative applications.The unit explores a specific set of approaches for both interactive and offline Machine Learning using common tools and frameworks such as Tensorflow, Torch, Keras and TFlearn, or equivalent. Fundamental concepts such as classification, clustering and regression are developed through practical problem solving including gesture recognition and tracking, sound and image classification, and text processing. Problems such sequence matching using probabilistic and stochastic processes (MMs, HMMs) are explained explored, as are contemporary ML approaches including basic RNNs/LSTMs, CNNs, GANs SEQ2SEQ, PIX2PIX Word2Vec and other emerging methods.

Indicative Content
Understanding and applying advanced ML methods (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Sequence Matching)
Building ML systems for problem solving (Gesture, Image, Sound and Text classification / tracking)
ML systems for Creative Applications – image generation, sound generation
On completion of this unit you will be able to:
Understand how to program advanced ML systems, such as Markov chains, Neural Nets and similar systems from scratch in any language. (Knowledge)
Understand and use ML fundamental concepts such as classification and regression in both real and non-real time. (Knowledge)
Create, test and deploy ML systems for problem solving (Gesture, Image, Sound and Text classification / tracking) in real and non-real time. (Knowledge)
Create, test and deploy ML systems for bespoke creative applications such as image, sound, Text generation in advance contexts. (Knowledge)

Assessment Requirements
Element 1: In-class testing. Students will work individually in class in order to complete a set of problem-solving assignments, which will be submitted for grading at the end of each session. (50%)
Element 2: Final Project: Students will deliver a final project to demonstrate their knowledge in core areas such as selecting and preparing data, evaluating appropriate machine learning models, selecting a model type, training models, and evaluating model performance in a specific application domain (50%)


Teaching and Learning Methods
The course is delivered through a series of lectures and practical workshops. Core learning is delivered in short lectures with practical examples. This learning is then reinforced through weekly workshops. All material is delivered in both abstract and contextualised forms, reinforcing both the value of mathematical principles, and their usefulness in real terms. Each session, you will work in teams to solve challenges using material presented to them in class. You will undertake practical tasks exploring specific computational problems that can be solved through programming.
